- When real estate agents list a property for sale the property listing is shown online on the websites of up to 24 syndication partners. 
- We would like to be able to provide a PDF report that shows how the property listing appears on each of the different partner websites.
- Given a spreadsheet of active listings, return an individual PDF report for each listing in the spreadsheet where each page of the PDF displays a screenshot of the syndication partner site showing the listing.
- Each page should have text to identify the listing, the partner site, and the date the screenshot was taken.
- An alternate interaction would be to have an interface where a user could enter a property address and receive the PDF report as an output.
